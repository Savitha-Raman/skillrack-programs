A number N is passed as the input.
The program must print the difference between the next immediate prime number and the previous immediate prime number. 
If the given number N itself is a prime number then print 0 (zero).
Input Format: The first line will contain the value of the number N. 
Boundary Conditions: 2 <= N <= 9999999 
Output Format: The difference between the next immediate prime number and the previous immediate prime number for N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 14 
Output: 4
Explanation: The next immediate prime number is 17. 
The previous immediate prime number is 13. Hence their difference = 17-13 = 4 is printed as output.
Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 23
Output: 0
Explanation: 23 itself is a prime number. Hence the output is 0.
Example Input/Output 3: 
Input: 2580 
Output: 12 
Explanation: The next immediate prime number is 2591.
The previous immediate prime number is 2579. Hence their difference 12 is printed as output.
